The method for keeping the shapes in the bounds of the canvas is somewhat smelly.
It's self-documenting, but the method is a little confusing.
Couldn't determine a more elegant way of keeping shapes within the bounds.

Also, couldn't determine a way to keep it in the shape class and also get the width/height of the canvas, so constants were made.

I feel as though the bounds checking method fits better in the ShapeManager class,
but doing so would require that I made methods in the Shape class static.
